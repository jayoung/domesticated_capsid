### script to download chain files (for liftOver) for hg38 versus placental mammals, using the same assemblies used by the 100-way alignment


## liftOver options notes:
## these are the parameters that give the same output as the web liftOver (at least for panTro4):
# -minMatch=0.N Minimum ratio of bases that must remap. Default 0.95

## these are other parameters I toyed with, but might not use:
# -minBlocks=0.49 -fudgeThick
# -minBlocks=0.N Minimum ratio of alignment blocks or exons that must map
#              (default 1.00)
# -fudgeThick    (bed 12 or 12+ only) If thickStart/thickEnd is not mapped,
#              use the closest mapped base.  Recommended if using -minBlocks.


## I use downloaded chain files. I also tried using a remote chain file (e.g. http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/liftOver/hg38ToSusScr3.over.chain.gz), but it failed to find the lifted over region, despite the fact it succeeded with the same chain file stored locally. It was also slow.

my $bedInputFile = "allRefSeqs.hg38.justCDS.bed";

### this has a list of the assemblies we expect to see
my $assemblyListFile = "/fh/fast/malik_h/grp/public_databases/UCSC/human_Dec2013/conservation_tracks/README.placentalMammals.txt";

## specify any assemblies we DON'T want to liftOver here
my %assembliesToIgnore;
$assembliesToIgnore{'hg38'}=1;  ## meaningless to chain against itself

my $chainFilesDir = "/fh/fast/malik_h/grp/public_databases/UCSC/human_Dec2013/liftOverFiles";

my $liftOverExecutable = "./liftOver";

my $liftOverOptions = "-minMatch=0.1";
