### for splitting PNMA and SIRH seqs into subgroups for better alignments, I started trying CD-HIT and blastclust, but realised that a blast-back to human genes approach would be better

module load CD-HIT

### problem: for cd-hit-est, can only cluster on 80% or higher.
### for PEG10 I am reluctant to cluster using protein seqs, because of the programmed frameshift
# -c 0.4 : need 40% identity, calculated as num matches / length shorter seq
# -T 4 = 4 threads

cd-hit-est -T 4 -c 0.4 -i SIRHseqsToAlign2.fa -o SIRHseqsToAlign2.cdhit40.txt 

module purge

#### try blastclust

blastclust --help

### parameters I am using:
# -a 4 num threads
# -L Length coverage threshold default = 0.9
# -S  Score coverage threshold (bit score / length if < 3.0, percentage of identities otherwise)   default = 1.75
# -p  Is input proteins? [T/F] default = TRUE
### parameters I am NOT using, but maybe I want to:
# -b  Require coverage on both neighbours? [T/F]   default = TRUE

blastclust -i SIRHseqsToAlign2.fa -a 4 -o SIRHseqsToAlign2.clustList.txt -s SIRHseqsToAlign2.clustNeighbors.txt -L 0.5 -S 40 -p F
