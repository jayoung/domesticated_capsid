##### workflow, in detail

## (1) take all human seq names in 2020.23.10.CA.Hs.refseq.accessions.csv and ../fromWill/2_2020_Oct23_seqs/2020.23.10.CA.final.seqs.refseq.repbase.accessions.csv (a mix of Refseq and repbase proteins, including some that may have droppped out when Will did CD-Hit and Trimal filters

cd ~/FH_fast_storage/miscMalikLab/domesticated_gags_BlakeWiedenheft/getHumanPepsFromWillFiles

../scripts/getHumanSeqsFullLen.bioperl
../scripts/getHumanSeqsJustCapsid.bioperl

there are 71 different seqs to get, after combining those two lists

some seqs are in Will's seq file twice, looks like because they either had two chunks of match to an HMM, or they matched two different HMMs.  He does have a downstream step of using CD-HIT to get rid of redundant seqs, so only one will have made it into his alignment and tree, which is good.  I'll just keep the first one here, doesn't matter which I keep

## look at the genbank entries for the seqs Will got from RefSeq: 
# get plain Refseqs:

    they're the same, so I can just use one

xxx problem:
species where there is a gap with unalignable stuff in it appear as pseudogenes when they're not really, e.g. CCDC8 rheMac3

I may be able to use liftover to get seqs to align, instead of mafs.  that would work with rheMac3 and susScr3 for CCDC8 and give me intact seqs

I think I would have to download the chain files

#### getting DNA seqs from remote repo:

######## getting alignments via liftOver, rather than through 100-way maf:

"The over.chain files that the liftOver tool uses for coordinate conversions are less stringent compared to the filtered alignments used in the reciprocal best files, which constructs this particular multiz track."


### download the relevant chain files for liftOver:
scripts/getChainFiles.pl


### prep bed file for all RefSeq genes:
cd liftOver_alignments
cat ../multiz_alignments/*bed > allRefSeqs.hg38.bed


## get only the CDS, as liftOver in sensitive to bits that are missing, and I only care about the CDS.  I initially did it with the full length of the transcript - moved results to liftOverFiles_fullTranscript

I wrote a script to do get a new bed file that shows only the CDS, although I had also asked scicomp to installed a program called bedparse that should do the same thing: 
https://bedparse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Usage.html
usage: bedparse cds transcripts.bed 

cd liftOver_alignments
../scripts/bed12_getCDSonly.pl allRefSeqs.hg38.bed 


### use liftOver (for now, this still tries to get full transcript, not just CDS)
../scripts/runLiftOver.pl
mv allRefSeqs.hg38.justCDS.liftOver.* liftOverFiles_justCDS/liftOverFiles

I checked results for chimp (panTro4). With the scicomp installed version of liftOver (Kent_tools/20200519-linux.x86_64), there was one unmapped transcript that should have been mapped according to online liftOver (NM_001143978.3).  With a newly downloaded liftOver, it was mapped.



## get cds seqs using liftOver mapped.bed files:

I use ucscApiClient and the coords in the bed file, line by line.  Parse the resulting JSON output to get a fasta file. Reverse-complement if needed. 

The cds.fa files contain CDS seqs I did manage to get. There are 38 of those files.
The unmapped.bed file will record which queries I don't have.
The getCDSlog.txt files will record species that totally failed. There are 19 species:
    grep 'Assembly not supported by ucscApiClient' *log.txt  | wc

cd ~/FH_fast_storage/miscMalikLab/domesticated_capsid/liftOver_alignments/liftOverFiles_justCDS/liftOverFiles

../../../scripts/getCDSseqsUsingAPIclient.bioperl -returnType=cds *.mapped.bed 

## collect together each ortholog for each gene
../../../scripts/compileSameTranscriptSeqs.bioperl ../../allRefSeqs.hg38.cds.fa *cds.fa
mv *cdsSeqs.fa ../alignments/
cd ../alignments/

## align with MACSE

then used R script to make a plot


######### comparing multiz- and liftOver-based alignments

Using liftOver means the number of things called pseudogenes is a lot lower (e.g. for CCDC8). 
The maf alignments missed out poorly-aligning but in-frame regions

But using liftOver means a lot of species are missing entirely (e.g. for ARC), because liftOver failed.

xxx now I have run liftOver with just the CDS - see how much better that does.

xxx then implement Jairo Gonzalez's advice about getting seqs from other genomes

xx other ideas:
playing with liftOver parameters to report partial genes, or fudge edges, will also improve its hit rate

use BLAST to get just intact genes from NCBI NR (require mutual best blast) (won't get pseudogenes, probably)

use BLAT or sim4-like program to get intact and pseudogenes from entire assemblies (should get pseudogenes as well), and blat/blast back to human to check we get the right bits

use liftOver to get a bigger region from the genome, then use sim4 or BLAT to get the spliced CDS

xxxx


xxx next:
    make tables summarizing NUMBERS of intact/pseudo?
    make tables summarizing intact/pseud status by species?




xxx what to do with the Repbase things that Will found?  I think I will want to
1. find where they are in the hg38 - there will be multiple versions of each
2. ignore any that overlap with the things I already looked at because they're in the RefSeq set
3. look at the rest and see if there is an intact ORF, and if so do the same thing with getting the mafs and processing them


## after looking at the gene names in 2020.23.10.humanSeqs.fullLen.Refseq.accs.txt.info.byGene.txt, and a review paper by Kaneko-Ishino (fig 7), I realized there are a few more that Will might be missing:
RTL4
RTL9
PNMA8C
PNMA6B (pseudogene)

# get their seqs and do PFAM search
cd ~/FH_fast_storage/miscMalikLab/domesticated_capsid/additionalHits
../scripts/getgenbankJY_eutils_gbFormat.bioperl RTL4.txt RTL9.txt PNMA8C.txt

../scripts/searchPFAMprotqueryNew.pl RTL4.txt.gb.fa RTL9.txt.gb.fa PNMA8C.txt.gb.fa
../scripts/searchPFAMprotqueryNewMoreSensitive.pl RTL4.txt.gb.fa RTL9.txt.gb.fa PNMA8C.txt.gb.fa 
    xxxx should they have been in Will's table? maybe they don't have the capsid region? if so tell him


## (3) figure out for each location(s) in the human genome (hg38)
   ## which human genome version?  hg38 or hg19? whichever has more conservation tracks available.  hg38 and hg19 both have 100 vertebrates. hg38 also has a 27 (or 30?) primates track, and hg19 does not.  USE HG38.
   
   ## (i) For the Refseq proteins I'll try BLAT looking at exact and almost exact matches - try require 95% identity

cd ~/FH_fast_storage/miscMalikLab/domesticated_gags_BlakeWiedenheft/mapToHg38/Refseq
ln -s ../../getHumanPepsFromWillFiles/*Refseq.fa .

# get ooc file for hg38 for blatX searches:

## (ii) For the Repbase proteins I will want to be a bit more tolerant of mismatch, but I can exclude hits with frameshifts/stops

cd ~/FH_fast_storage/miscMalikLab/domesticated_capsid/testData/multiz_alignments/ZCCHC12

### getting maf files, given a bed file:

module load Kent_tools
mafFetch hg38 multiz100way PNMA3region.bed PNMA3region.100way.maf
    not sure what it would do if my bed interval contained blocks?  I will want that to work, I think


grep 'NM_013364'  ~/public_databases/UCSC/human_Dec2013/misc_tracks/hg38.refGene.2020dec3.bed > PNMA3_NM_013364.refGene.bed

##### use mafFrags to download alignment for a single ORF specified in a single bed file (if the bed file had >1 ORF I would need to somehow split the maf after getting it):

(mafFetch gets the entire genomic region, whereas mafFrags gets just the exons)

#### more notes about 100-way alignment display. I may want to think about parsing the between maf-block info

Gap Annotation
The Display chains between alignments configuration option enables display of gaps between alignment blocks in the pairwise alignments in a manner similar to the Chain track display. The following conventions are used:

Single line: No bases in the aligned species. Possibly due to a lineage-specific insertion between the aligned blocks in the human genome or a lineage-specific deletion between the aligned blocks in the aligning species.
Double line: Aligning species has one or more unalignable bases in the gap region. Possibly due to excessive evolutionary distance between species or independent indels in the region between the aligned blocks in both species.
Pale yellow coloring: Aligning species has Ns in the gap region. Reflects uncertainty in the relationship between the DNA of both species, due to lack of sequence in relevant portions of the aligning species.

Genomic Breaks
Discontinuities in the genomic context (chromosome, scaffold or region) of the aligned DNA in the aligning species are shown as follows:

Vertical blue bar: Represents a discontinuity that persists indefinitely on either side, e.g. a large region of DNA on either side of the bar comes from a different chromosome in the aligned species due to a large scale rearrangement.
Green square brackets: Enclose shorter alignments consisting of DNA from one genomic context in the aligned species nested inside a larger chain of alignments from a different genomic context. The alignment within the brackets may represent a short misalignment, a lineage-specific insertion of a transposon in the human genome that aligns to a paralogous copy somewhere else in the aligned species, or other similar occurrence.


## see other maf tools listed here: http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/

mafFrag - Extract maf sequences for a region from database (perhaps similar to mafFetch, but I specify coords on command line)

mafFrags - Collect MAFs from regions specified in a 6 column bed file (perhaps this is what I need for multi-exon bed intervals?)

mafSpeciesSubset - Extract a maf that just has a subset of species. (perhaps I will want to ignore non-mammals, or bad genomes)
